✅ 8. Container Orchestration

Kubernetes (K8s) ✅

Architecture

Pods, Deployments, Services, ReplicaSets

ConfigMaps & Secrets

Ingress & LoadBalancer

Helm (package manager for K8s)

Volumes, PV, PVC

RBAC (Role-based access control)

Health checks (liveness, readiness)

Autoscaling (HPA, VPA)

Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

✅ 9. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform (most important)

Providers

Modules

State management

Remote backend

Workspaces

AWS CloudFormation (optional)

✅ 10. Cloud Providers (hands-on required)

Fluentd / Fluent Bit

Loki (for logs with Grafana)

✅ 13. Continuous Delivery & Deployment (CD)
Blue-Green Deployment

Canary Deployment

Rolling Update

ArgoCD (for GitOps deployment)

Spinnaker (optional advanced tool)

✅ 14. Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)
Secrets management (Vault, SOPS, Sealed Secrets)

SAST & DAST (Static/Dynamic App Security Testing)

Dependency scanning (Snyk, Trivy)

Container image scanning

Secure CI/CD pipelines

✅ 15. Networking Basics (Very Important)

 Professional ReactJS Project Process (Company Level Working) 

 1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis
    Client ya stakeholder se requirement collect ki jati hai. Functional + non-functional features define hote hain.
 2. Wireframing & UI/UX Design
    UI flow design hota hai. Wireframes & prototypes banaye jaate hain using Figma, Adobe XD, etc.
 3. Tech Stack Finalization
    ReactJS, Redux, React Query, Tailwind, Node.js, MongoDB jaise tools decide hote hain.
 4. Project Initialization & Repo Setup
    Git repo banaya jata hai, folder structure set hoti hai, ESLint, Prettier, Husky configure kiya jata hai.
 5. Environment Setup
    .env files create ki jaati hain for development, staging, production etc.
 6. Component Planning
    Atomic Design ya feature-based structure follow karte hain for reusable components.
 7. API Contract Finalization
    Swagger ya Postman ke through frontend-backend API contracts finalize hote hain.
 8. Component Development (UI First)
    UI skeleton components banaye jaate hain, placeholders and loaders ke saath.
 9. State Management
    Redux Toolkit / Context API / Zustand etc. ka use hota hai for state handling.
 10. API Integration
    Axios ya fetch se API call ki jaati hai with error handling and interceptors.

 11. Routing (React Router)
    Public/private routes, lazy loading, nested routes implement hote hain.
 12. Form Handling
    Formik / React Hook Form ke through validation, controlled/uncontrolled forms banaye jaate hain.
 13. Authentication & Authorization
    JWT, Google login, Role-based access setup hota hai with token management.
 14. Testing
    Jest, React Testing Library se unit/integration tests likhe jaate hain, Cypress for E2E.
 15. Error Boundaries & Fallbacks
    React ErrorBoundary, Suspense fallback for crashes and loading states.
 16. Performance Optimization
    useMemo, lazy loading, debouncing, code splitting se performance improve karte hain.
 17. Accessibility (a11y)
    ARIA roles, screen reader, keyboard navigation support add karte hain.
 18. Analytics & Monitoring
    Google Analytics, Sentry, Mixpanel use karte hain for tracking and error logs.
 19. CI/CD Setup
    GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Netlify/Vercel for automatic testing, build, deploy.
 20. Code Review & Merge Process
    PR raise hoti hai, senior devs review karte hain, approved PR merge hoti hai.

 21. UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
    Client staging version test karta hai, feedback deta hai, final changes hote hain.
 22. Production Build
    Production optimized build create hota hai with minified, secure code.
 23. Post-Deployment Monitoring
    Downtime alerts, user feedback, error tracking tools se monitor karte hain.
 24. Maintenance & Feature Iteration
    Bugs fix, tech debt resolve, naye features continuously add hote hain.
 25. Documentation
    Codebase, API, README, and developer onboarding docs maintain ki jaati hain.
 26. Service Workers & PWA Support
    Offline support aur better performance ke liye service workers use hote hain. PWA features enable karne ke
    liye serviceWorker.register() ka use hota hai.
 27. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
    Initial load time reduce karne ke liye React.lazy() aur Suspense ka use hota hai for component-based lazy
    loading.
 28. Internationalization (i18n)
    Multi-language support ke liye react-i18next jaise libraries use ki jaati hain.
 29. SEO Optimization
    Search engine visibility improve karne ke liye SSR ya SSG frameworks jaise Next.js ka use kiya jaata hai.

 30. Accessibility (a11y) Enhancements
    Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation ensure kiya jaata hai taaki app differently-abled users
    ke liye bhi accessible ho.
 31. Performance Monitoring
    Lighthouse, Web Vitals, custom analytics use hote hain to monitor app performance after deployment.
 32. Security Best Practices
    HTTPS, CSP, input validation jaise security features implement kiye jaate hain to keep the app secure.

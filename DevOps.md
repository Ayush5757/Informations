Complete DevOps Roadmap - Beginner to Advanced
DevOps is considered a set of practices that combines the abilities of Software Development i.e Dev and IT Operations i.e Ops together, which results in delivering top-notch quality software fastly and more efficiently. Its focus is to encourage communication, collaboration, and integration between the software development team and IT operations to maintain the software development lifecycle. 

Complete DevOps Roadmap - Beginner to Advanced
Learn DevOps from industry experts to enhance your workflow efficiency and master the rapid release of high-quality software. 

Checkout: DevOps Engineering – Planning to Production

Now, you understand DevOp's meaning but the question arises Is there any particular designation for this type of work?

Yes, there is a specific job designation i.e DevOps Engineer. A DevOps Engineer is a person who manages DevOps practices and ensures the streamlined flow of the deployment process. Its key responsibilities may vary from organization to organization but here are some key roles and responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer:

Implementing CI/CD operations.
Automating the Infrastructure.
Collaborating with different teams mainly SDE teams and IT operations teams.
Managing the availability and performance of the Software applications.
Troubleshooting and resolving the issues of the organization.
You would be wondering How much a DevOps Engineer could earn by doing this job. Let me tell you the stats, Average salary of a DevOps engineer is 9-10 LPA and it goes up to 20 LPA as well as the average salary of a senior DevOps Engineer ranges between 16- 18 LPA and can go up to more than 35 Lakhs per year.

In this article, we would be learning a full-proof roadmap of How to become a DevOps Engineer or DevOps Roadmap. So, let's begin the journey

Roadmap To DevOps

1. Select a Programming Language (Week - 1)
Selecting a language may be a difficult task for a developer but for starting a career in the IT industry it is recommended to select any programming language as your primary language so that you can pursue a further career in the software industry. In this journey of learning DevOps, we will be proceeding further by choosing any one of the two languages i.e Python OR Go lang programming language. As both Python and Go lang are easy-to-learn languages, they both have easy-to-understand syntax and have a large scope in the future.

So let's see what are the most important topic which you need to look around to have good knowledge of a programming language.

Python 

GoLang

Note: We suggest you to chose any one programming language of the two. 

2. OS Concepts (Week 2)
Moving ahead in the journey, it becomes necessary to have your fundamentals strong, as you are going to work directly with the software systems you need to have a solid understanding of Operating Systems and their basic concepts. There are several reasons why you need to learn OS concepts:

To understand the system architecture.
To automate and configure management.
To troubleshoot and debug.
To apply the best security measures.
Below we have divided this section into three different domains- Operating Systems, Virtualisation, and Networking Protocols. So, without wasting much time let's take a look.

3. Linux (Week 2 - 3)
If you are going into DevOps, you need to live in the terminal, for the same, it becomes necessary to have a keen knowledge of command-line-based Operating Systems, and when it comes to the command line the only thing that comes to mind is Linux.

Linux is an open-source operating system that would be needed for collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement of Software Development and IT Operations. The key reasons why you need to learn Linux are- 

It is widely used in DevOps environments.
Mainly used for Scripting and Automation .
Below are listed some of the key concepts regarding Linux.

Command Line
Bash and Shell Scripting
Package Management
Networking Tools
Security Concepts
4. SCM (Week - 4)
It's time to learn more about the functioning of DevOps in detail, this learning can't be completed without the inclusion of SCM which stands for Source Code Management in DevOps. In DevOps workflow, SCM plays a critical role as it gives the ability to control and track changes through VCS i.e Version Control Systems. In this journey, we would suggest you get hands-on with  Git and Github as VCS.
